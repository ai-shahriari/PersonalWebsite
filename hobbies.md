* Walking until my legs give out. Often with no particular destination in mind.
* Dwelling on impossible possibilities just for the sake of it.
* Looking for new bakeries.
* Carefully examining the ceiling.
* Philosophizing about right and wrong.
* Dehydrating.
* Playing hide-and-seek with my belongings.
